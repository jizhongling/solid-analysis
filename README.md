# solid-analysis

Analysis macros for SoLID detector simulation and reconstruction.
First need to compile the solid_dd4hep and solid_recon code.
To run the script, use EIC container version 25.05-stable and run

```bash
./eic-shell -v 25.05-stable
cd solid-analysis
./run_sim_gun <nevents> <index>
```
